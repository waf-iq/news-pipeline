            "   Text: من هو مقداد فتيحة زعيم ميليشيا لواء درع الساحل في سوريا؟في أواخر فبراير شباط الماضي، ظهر مقداد فتيحة في مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي ليعلن عن تأسيس ميليشيا عسكرية جديدة في سوريا أطلق عليها لواء درع الساحل، وقال في تسجيل مصوّر إنه يؤسس هذا اللواء لحماية أبناء الطائفة العلوية في الساحل السوري ضد ما وصفه بـ تجاوزات عصابات الجولاني.ولم يكتف فتيحة بتأسيس لواء مسلح فقط، بل دعا أيضاً أبناء الطائفة العلوية إلى مقاومة ما سماه محاولات نزع السلاح من مناطقهم، عبر عمليات أمنية يفترض أن تقودها السلطات المركزية.كما دعا إلى قتل أي عناصر تحاول الدخول إلى قراهم.وأكد أنه سيقود عمليات عسكرية في الساحل السوري للدفاع عمّا وصفه بـالطائفة والوطن، مشدداً على أن المليشيا التي يتزعمها تسعى لمواجهة أي تحرك حكومي في المناطق التي ينشط فيها.فمن هو مقداد فتيحة؟على المستوى الشخصي، لا تتوفر معلومات مؤكدة حول تاريخ ميلاد فتيحة أو مسقط رأسه، لكن مصادر عدة تربطه بجبل اللاذقية ومدينة جبلة، وبعضها يؤكد أنه وُلد عام 1987 وينتمي للطائفة العلوية من منطقة الساحل السوري.وعمل مقداد لؤي فتيحة، المعروف بلقب أبو جعفر في بيئة عسكرية وأمنية مرتبطة بالولاء لنظام بشار الأسد، إذ تطوع في الفرقة 25 التابعة للحرس الجمهوري، وهي الفرقة التي كانت تعتبر من النخبة في الجيش السوري، ومسؤولة عن حماية الرئاسة، واشتهرت بارتكابها عمليات القمع ضد المعارضين منذ عام 2011.وحين بدأ الصراع السوري في عام 2011، كان فتيحة على الخطوط الأمامية في الحملة ضد المتظاهرين والمعارضين، الأمر الذي جعله أحد أبرز وجوه النظام في تلك المرحلة، بحسب تقارير صحفية كشفت عن دوره القمعي المباشر ضد المدنيين.وظهر في تسجيلات أثناء المعارك في الحرب الأهلية حيث علَّق على مسار المعارك، وبرر الانسحابات العسكرية للقوات الموالية للأسد.ويتهم ناشطون سوريون فتيحة، بأن له سجلاً أسود إبّان خدمته مع قوات النظام السابق، وتُنسب له انتهاكات جسيمة وجرائم تعذيب.وقد أسفرت تلك الاشتباكات عن مصرع وإصابة العشرات من عناصر الأمن والمدنيين، كما أسر أنصاره نحو 200 من عناصر الأمن والمدنيين.وظهر فتيحة في فيديو مصور ثان في 13 مارسآذار الماضي، وهو يرتدي زي الأمن العام ويهدد قوات وزارة الدفاع والأمن بما سماه المرحلة الثانية من المعركة إذا لم تنسحب من قرى الساحل، وهدد بتفخيخ الطرقات وإعدام الأسرى.ومازال موقع فتيحة غامضاً حيث رجّحت بعض المصادر إنه يقيم في لبنان، وتحديداً في منطقة جبل محسن بمحافظة طرابلس، لكن لم يتم الجزم بذلك.وتلاحق فتيحة اتهامات بممارسة أنشطة غير شرعية تشمل الاتجار بالمخدرات، والرشوة، والاختطاف والقتل، حسب ما ذكرته تقارير.\n",

            "📝 Sentence: من هو مقداد فتيحة زعيم ميليشيا لواء درع الساحل في سوريا؟في أواخر فبراير شباط الماضي، ظهر مقداد فتيحة في مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي ليعلن عن تأسيس ميليشيا عسكرية جديدة في سوريا أطلق عليها لواء درع الساحل، وقال في تسجيل مصوّر إنه يؤسس هذا اللواء لحماية أبناء الطائفة العلوية في الساحل السوري ضد ما وصفه بـ تجاوزات عصابات الجولاني.ولم يكتف فتيحة بتأسيس لواء مسلح فقط، بل دعا أيضاً أبناء الطائفة العلوية إلى مقاومة ما سماه محاولات نزع السلاح من مناطقهم، عبر عمليات أمنية يفترض أن تقودها السلطات المركزية.كما دعا إلى قتل أي عناصر تحاول الدخول إلى قراهم.وأكد أنه سيقود عمليات عسكرية في الساحل السوري للدفاع عمّا وصفه بـالطائفة والوطن، مشدداً على أن المليشيا التي يتزعمها تسعى لمواجهة أي تحرك حكومي في المناطق التي ينشط فيها.فمن هو مقداد فتيحة؟على المستوى الشخصي، لا تتوفر معلومات مؤكدة حول تاريخ ميلاد فتيحة أو مسقط رأسه، لكن مصادر عدة تربطه بجبل اللاذقية ومدينة جبلة، وبعضها يؤكد أنه وُلد عام 1987 وينتمي للطائفة العلوية من منطقة الساحل السوري.وعمل مقداد لؤي فتيحة، المعروف بلقب أبو جعفر في بيئة عسكرية وأمنية مرتبطة بالولاء لنظام بشار الأسد، إذ تطوع في الفرقة 25 التابعة للحرس الجمهوري، وهي الفرقة التي كانت تعتبر من النخبة في الجيش السوري، ومسؤولة عن حماية الرئاسة، واشتهرت بارتكابها عمليات القمع ضد المعارضين منذ عام 2011.وحين بدأ الصراع السوري في عام 2011، كان فتيحة على الخطوط الأمامية في الحملة ضد المتظاهرين والمعارضين، الأمر الذي جعله أحد أبرز وجوه النظام في تلك المرحلة، بحسب تقارير صحفية كشفت عن دوره القمعي المباشر ضد المدنيين.وظهر في تسجيلات أثناء المعارك في الحرب الأهلية حيث علَّق على مسار المعارك، وبرر الانسحابات العسكرية للقوات الموالية للأسد.ويتهم ناشطون سوريون فتيحة، بأن له سجلاً أسود إبّان خدمته مع قوات النظام السابق، وتُنسب له انتهاكات جسيمة وجرائم تعذيب.وقد أسفرت تلك الاشتباكات عن مصرع وإصابة العشرات من عناصر الأمن والمدنيين، كما أسر أنصاره نحو 200 من عناصر الأمن والمدنيين.وظهر فتيحة في فيديو مصور ثان في 13 مارسآذار الماضي، وهو يرتدي زي الأمن العام ويهدد قوات وزارة الدفاع والأمن بما سماه المرحلة الثانية من المعركة إذا لم تنسحب من قرى الساحل، وهدد بتفخيخ الطرقات وإعدام الأسرى.ومازال موقع فتيحة غامضاً حيث رجّحت بعض المصادر إنه يقيم في لبنان، وتحديداً في منطقة جبل محسن بمحافظة طرابلس، لكن لم يتم الجزم بذلك.وتلاحق فتيحة اتهامات بممارسة أنشطة غير شرعية تشمل الاتجار بالمخدرات، والرشوة، والاختطاف والقتل، حسب ما ذكرته تقارير.\n",
